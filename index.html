      <p>Being married to Mary Ann Clayton for 49 years is my greatest asset. I'm a husband, father, and grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>As a graduate of Brigham Young University in Art, and also a graduate of many shorter programs mostly in User
        Experience Design and front-end web technologies, I have been employed, usually as a contractor, by huge and
        small
        firms, usually for fairly short periods of time -- that seems to be the way it's done in this industry. I've
        worked for Wells Fargo Bank, WAMU Bank (now defunct -- NOT my fault!), Sony, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Fidelity,
        Pacific Life, Fedex, California Court System, County of San Diego, and many others.</p>
      <p>Many awards for computer graphics, graphic design, and for UX Design have been heaped upon me.</p>
      <p>The Sierra is awesome for hiking and camping, the sky is amazing for flying airplanes (I'm a licensed Private
        Pilot, single-engine land, with sailplane), and I take pictures. I paint and sculpt and draw in both digital
        and
        analog mediums.</p>
      <p>Professional photography was a major part of my livlihood for 20 years while I was also doing advertising and
        design for Sanyo Mainframe computers, Voit Sporting Goods, Teal Industries, Gradco, Toshiba, Microsoft, PWC and
        many others.</p>
